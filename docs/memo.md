## Setup

I ran a local instance of OpenTripPlanner (OTP) on my machine, based on the configuration provided in the MBTA's [opt-deploy repo](https://github.com/mbta/otp-deploy). The only change I made to the provided repository was to update the version of OTP used to the 2.6.0 release.

This configuration utilizes OSM data for Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and GTFS data for the MBTA and Massport.
